# ClearLens — Trust & Transparency Dashboard

ClearLens is a front-end web application designed to explore how trust, transparency, and user experiences can be represented in software systems using clear, explainable logic.

This project was built as a portfolio sample to demonstrate practical web development skills, ethical design thinking, and real-world problem framing.

## 🔍 Project Overview

ClearLens allows users to:
- Submit experiences about a provider or brand
- Categorize outcomes (Improved, No Change, Negative)
- View community-submitted reports
- See a calculated Trust Score based on reported outcomes
- Understand how the scoring system works through an ethics & transparency section

The application avoids “black box” logic and instead prioritizes simplicity, clarity, and explainability.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** — semantic structure
- **CSS3** — modern responsive layout using Grid, variables, and card-based UI
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** — form handling, scoring logic, DOM manipulation
- **LocalStorage** — client-side data persistence

No external frameworks or libraries were used.

## 📊 Trust Score Logic

The Trust Score is calculated using a simple weighted model:
- Positive outcome = 2 points
- Neutral outcome = 1 point
- Negative outcome = 0 points

The score is displayed as a percentage based on total possible points, making the system transparent and easy to understand.

## ⚖️ Ethics & Design Philosophy

ClearLens was intentionally designed with ethical considerations in mind:
- No hidden algorithms
- No popularity-based ranking
- No medical claims or advice
- Emphasis on transparency over persuasion

The project demonstrates how ethical responsibility can be incorporated into software design.
